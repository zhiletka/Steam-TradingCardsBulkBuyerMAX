TODO/KNOWN ISSUES:

1. OBSERVATORY (5) $0.15 - You cannot buy any items until your previous action completes.
2. Infinite canceling of some active orders {success: 40, error: "Cannot process this request until your other request completes."}. Anyway they become canceled after page reload.
3. let prices = $(cards[i]).data('history').prices conflicts with original script "Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'prices' of undefined".
4. Sometimes sell_order_graph contains fewer records than card actually has on its page, for example https://steamcommunity.com/id/zhiletka/gamecards/554640.
5. Probably, the $0.03 price when no sell or buy orders found should be changed to median price.
